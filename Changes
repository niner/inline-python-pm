Revision history for Perl extension Inline::Python.

0.43 Tue  Sep 02 11:00:00 CEST 2014 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fix memory corruption introduced with boolean support
	- Document the usage of Inline::Python::Boolean
	- Minor doc fixes by Zakariyya Mughal
	- Allow non-interactive installation in Makefile.PL
	- Add links to the github repo by mohawk2

0.42  Fri May 31 20:20:00 CEST 2013 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Python booleans passed through Perl make it back to Python as Booleans
	  instead of Integers.
	- Fix segfaults on Perl 5.18.0 caused by uninitialized fields in a data
	  structure. Should help performance as well.

0.41  Thu Nov 08 20:15:00 CET 2012 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fixed installation on systems only having a shared libpython
	- Code cleanup

0.40  Fri Jul 29 16:30:00 CEST 2011 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Finally fixed t/06dict.t allowing installation on many more machines

0.39  Wed Mar 09 13:00:00 CET 2011 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Added py_is_tuple and made Pl2Py recognize an array ref that has
	  been a tuple before in Python.
	- Fixed memory corruption on a Python function calling a Perl function
	  that changed the stack pointer.
	- Fixed several memory leaks (scalars and dict keys).
	- Fixed wrong refcount of return values in py_eval (RT #48081)
	- Fixed accessing Unicode keys in a dict passed from Perl.
	- Fixed compatability of t/30floats.t with Python 2.7.

0.38  Thu Dec 02 14:00:00 CEST 2010 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fix Perl assertion fail if __getitem__ called multiple times
	- Fix "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" sometimes happening when
	  calling a Perl sub with named parameters from Python.
	- Fix several memory leaks found using valgrind
	- Add py_finalize to be able to shut down the Python interpreter.

0.37  Thu Sep 30 09:30:00 CEST 2010 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Added line numbers to Python exception messages.
	- Fixed passing of a perl code ref through Python space.
	- Allow passing references to methods from Python to Perl.
	- Implemented py_has_attr complementing py_get_attr.
	- We now support stringification of Python objects via __str__ methods.
	- Fixed segfault when accessing a Python object's attributes throws an
	  exception.
	- Fixed some problems with the test suite, hopefully making installation
	  work on more machines.
	- Fixed compilation on Win32, linking still seems broken though :(

0.36  Mon Jun 23 12:45:00 CEST 2010 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fixed a segfault when passing dicts with Unicode keys to Perl
	- Pass Python exceptions to Perl instead of just printing to STDERR

0.35  Wed Mar 31 11:00:00 CET 2010 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fixed floats sometimes getting converted to int when transfered from Perl
	  to Python. Thanks to John McCullough for a great bug report.

0.34  Fri Mar 12 12:20:00 CET 2010 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fixed refcounting of positional arguments in named argument calls to Perl
	  subs.

0.33  Mon Feb 22 10:30:00 CET 2010 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Added support for named arguments for Perl subs

0.32  Fri Jan 29 20:00:00 CET 2010 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Perl UTF-8 strings now get converted to Python Unicode strings and vice
	  versa. This could potentially lead to incompatibilities with existing code.
	- Return lists of Perl subs no longer get reversed before passing to Python.

0.31  Sun Dec 06 15:30:00 CET 2009 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Implement access to Inline::Python::Object data

0.30  Sun Nov 29 19:45:00 CET 2009 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Convert Perl arrays to Python arrays instead of tuples
	- First look for methods before looking for attributes in PerlObj_getattr

0.29  Tue Jul 07 17:00:00 CEST 2009 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Implemented passing of subroutine references and lambda expressions from
	  Python to Perl space.
	- Implemented Python's __getitem__ protocol for perl objects. Perl objects
	  can thus be used like dictionaries if they support a __getitem__ sub.
	- Fixed a bug in Pl2Py sometimes segfaulting on undefs in arrays.

0.28  Tue Dec 16 19:00:00 CET 2008 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fixed pushing integers from Python to Perl space. They now retain their
	  integer-ness instead of silently converting them to strings.
	- PerlObj objects now have a comparison function which asserts if the _same_
	  perl object is contained.
	- implemented Python's __getattr__ protocol for perl objects. Attributes can
	  now be accessed with my_perl_object.my_attribute same as Python objects.
	  The perl object just has to implement a __getattr__ sub.
	- __getattr__ now raises a KeyError if a PerlObj object does not have the
	  requested attribute instead of silently assuming that a method is being
	  called.
	- Added testcases for all these and for the Unicode fix in 0.27

0.27  Thu Nov 20 19:00:00 CET 2008 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fixed a segfault in py2pl.c when converting Unicode strings from Python to
	  Perl.
	- Attempt to check for Python.h in Makefile.pl to make it more visible to
	  the user.

0.26  Mon Nov 10 13:20:00 CET 2008 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Fixed compatibility with Python 2.5: all tests run successfully.
	- Documented the --enable-shared requirement

0.25  Thu Oct 02 22:20:00 CEST 2008 (Stefan Seifert)
	- Added missing changes and updated documentation to reflect current
	  status. No code changes.

0.24  Thu Oct 02 22:05:00 CEST 2008 (Stefan Seifert)
	- fixed many wrong refcounts leading to memory leaks and too early freed
	  objects. Most notably when returning more than one result from a perl
	  sub to python.
	- fixed segfaults in perlSub_getattr and perlSub_setattr for invalid
	  attribute names on non-methods.
	- added many testcases for refcounting

0.23  Mon Sep 29 11:50:00 CEST 2008 (Stefan Seifert)
	- fixed segfault when returing perl objects from python functions and methods
	- fixed uninitialized member variables of perl subs
	- updated documentation to reflect new co-maintainer

0.22  Sun Jan  9 22:29:54 PST 2005
	[Bug reported by David Dyck]
	- removed some declarations after statements
	- newer versions of gcc seem to accept this by default, while older
	  versions just croak. Of course, the older versions also don't
	  support -Wdeclaration-after-statement.

0.21  Mon Jul 26 13:40:57 CDT 2004
	[Patch from Eric Wilhelm]
	- Added support for 'new-style' python classes which subtype builtin
	  types per PEP's 252 and 253.

0.20  Mon Jul  9 16:46:56 PDT 2001
	- Made the Makefile.PL more clever about how it picks debugging 
	  information. It accepts an optional argument, too, so it's
	  easy to correct the mistakes.

0.20  Wed Jun 20 16:27:23 PDT 2001
	- Lots of testing with different versions of Perl & Python
	- Makefile.PL auto-detects configuration for python >= 2.0

0.20  Sun Jun 17 19:57:18 PDT 2001
	- Made eval_python return results of running code
	- py_bind_class(), py_bind_function(), and py_study_package()
	- py_eval() and py_call_function()
	- py_new_object() and py_call_method()
	- Many new test cases
	- Updated documentation
	- New language alias 'PYTHON' for Inline::Files support
	- 'FILTERS' Config option
	- Removed 'PRIVATE_PRIFIXES' Config option
	- Added new base class Inline::Python::Object for all objects.

0.15  Sun Jun 10 18:39:23 PDT 2001
	- Ported to Inline 0.42.

0.14  Thu Mar 22 08:50:33 PST 2001
	- Added support for passing binary strings between Python & Perl.

0.13  Sun Mar  4 22:09:35 PST 2001
	- Added Win32 code to search for Python installations on Win32
	- Eliminated GNU-specific preprocessor macro syntax

0.10  Thu Nov 23 16:46:27 PST 2000
	- Created Inline::Python.
